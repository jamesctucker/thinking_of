## Getting Your Local Environment Ready
1. Setup local postgres database
Install postgres via brew if not already installed.
Check that postgres is running with `brew services`.
Start the postgres command line with `psql`.
Create a new db with `createdb <db_name>`.
Check if the db was created by listing all of your databases with `\l`.
